## Data Structures
* [ ] Describe the difference between a stack and a queue and give examples of when you might use them.
	
		Stack : 
		1 - the stack FIFO (first in first out)
		2 - it's simlier to the array , just the deffrence in the implement 
		3 - make the values more readable for the user 

		example : 
		in the market when you want to pay for somthing , and there's people in front of you , so the fisrt one who's in the front of the casher he well go the first one , and the next , and the next , tell you arrive and you pay , then the stack well be empty  . 

		Queue  :
		1 - the queue FILO (fisrt in last out)
		2 - it's used in the kernal , in the cpu , when there's so many orders , the io( input , output) , when ever you use thim , they will be come up first .

		example : 
		i think i said one before , but like the deshies  , everyone but a dish , so the last one he but it , the fist one it going to be cleaned  .

## Queue vs. Stack
Please write your explanation below.

		Queue  :
		1 - the queue FILO (fisrt in last out)
		2 - it's used in the kernal , in the cpu , when there's so many orders , the io( input , output) , when ever you use thim , they will be come up first 
		3 - make you know what the last thing you make so , need to make it fist thing  .


				Stack : 
		1 - the stack FIFO (first in first out) . 
		2 - it's simlier to the array , just the deffrence in the implement  .
		3 - make the values more readable for the user .
